## 1. Introduction to Dapper
Dapper is a micro-ORM that works with various database providers. It is well-known for its performance due to its lightweight design and raw SQL execution capabilities. It simplifies the process of querying a database while providing control over the SQL statements being executed.

### 2. Setting Up Your Project
- Create a new .NET C# project in your preferred development environment.
- Install the Dapper package using NuGet Package Manager:
  ```bash
  Install-Package Dapper
  ```

## 3. Basic CRUD Operations
### 3.1 Connecting to the Database

using System.Data.SqlClient;
using Dapper;

string connectionString = "your_connection_string_here";
SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString);


### 3.2 Inserting Data
```csharp
var newProduct = new Product { Name = "Sample Product", Price = 9.99 };
string insertQuery = "INSERT INTO Products (Name, Price) VALUES (@Name, @Price)";
connection.Execute(insertQuery, newProduct);
```

### 3.3 Querying Data

string selectQuery = "SELECT * FROM Products";
List<Product> products = connection.Query<Product>(selectQuery).ToList();

### 3.4 Updating Data
```csharp
string updateQuery = "UPDATE Products SET Price = @Price WHERE Id = @Id";
connection.Execute(updateQuery, new { Price = 14.99, Id = 1 });
```

### 3.5 Deleting Data
```csharp
string deleteQuery = "DELETE FROM Products WHERE Id = @Id";
connection.Execute(deleteQuery, new { Id = 1 });
```

## 4. Advanced Querying
### 4.1 Parameterized Queries
```csharp
string query = "SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price > @Price";
List<Product> expensiveProducts = connection.Query<Product>(query, new { Price = 10 }).ToList();
```

### 4.2 Query Multiple Result Sets
```csharp
string multiQuery = "SELECT * FROM Customers; SELECT * FROM Orders;";
using (var multiResult = connection.QueryMultiple(multiQuery))
{
    List<Customer> customers = multiResult.Read<Customer>().ToList();
    List<Order> orders = multiResult.Read<Order>().ToList();
}
```

## 5. Mapping Relationships
Dapper supports one-to-one and one-to-many relationships using the `Query` and `Query` methods respectively.

## 6. Transactions and Bulk Operations
```csharp
using (var transaction = connection.BeginTransaction())
{
    try
    {
        // Perform multiple operations here
        transaction.Commit();
    }
    catch
    {
        transaction.Rollback();
    }
}
```

## 7. Performance Optimization
- Use async methods for asynchronous database operations.
- Enable query caching for frequently used queries.
- Pay attention to the performance impact of loading related entities.

## 8. Handling Stored Procedures
```csharp
string spName = "InsertProduct";
var parameters = new { Name = "New Product", Price = 19.99 };
connection.Execute(spName, parameters, commandType: CommandType.StoredProcedure);
```

## 9. Async Programming with Dapper
Dapper provides async methods to perform database operations asynchronously. Use `ExecuteAsync`, `QueryAsync`, and `QueryMultipleAsync` for asynchronous programming.

## 10. Best Practices and Tips
- Keep your SQL queries maintainable and organized.
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Consider separating database access logic from business logic using repositories or services.
