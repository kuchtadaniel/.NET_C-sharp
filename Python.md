## Basic Python Concepts

1. **What is Python and what are its key features?**
   Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. Key features include dynamic typing, automatic memory management, and an extensive standard library.

2. **What are Python namespaces and how do they work?**
   A namespace is a container that holds a set of identifiers (names) along with their corresponding objects. Python uses namespaces to manage variable names and avoid naming conflicts.

3. **Explain the differences between Python 2 and Python 3.**
   Python 3 introduced several breaking changes, including print as a function, Unicode strings by default, and integer division returning a float. Python 2 reached its end of life in January 2020.

## Data Types and Variables

6. **Differentiate between mutable and immutable data types.**
   Mutable types can be modified after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries), while immutable types cannot (e.g., strings, tuples).

7. **Explain the differences between lists, tuples, and sets.**
   Lists are ordered and mutable, tuples are ordered and immutable, and sets are unordered collections of unique elements.

8. **How are dictionaries implemented in Python?**
   Dictionaries use hash tables to store key-value pairs, allowing efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion.

9. **What is a variable in Python? How do you assign values to variables?**
   A variable is a name that refers to a value in memory. Assignment is done using the `=` operator, e.g., `x = 10`.

10. **Describe the concept of variable scope in Python.**
    Variable scope refers to the area in the code where a variable is accessible. Variables can have local or global scope.
   
## Control Structures

11. **What are conditional statements in Python? Provide examples.**
    Conditional statements allow executing different code based on conditions. Examples include `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

12. **Explain the usage of loops (for and while) in Python.**
    Loops repeat a set of instructions. `for` is used for iterating over sequences, and `while` loops execute while a condition is true.

13. **How do you iterate over items and indices of a list simultaneously?**
    You can use the `enumerate()` function to get both the index and value in a loop.

14. **What is the `range()` function used for?**
    The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers within a specified range. It's commonly used in loops.
