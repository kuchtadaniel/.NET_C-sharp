## Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. In this example, we'll use a simple username-password authentication approach.

```csharp
// Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // Configure authentication services
    services.AddAuthentication("MyAuthScheme")
        .AddCookie("MyAuthScheme", options =>
        {
            options.LoginPath = "/Account/Login"; // Redirect to login page if not authenticated
        });
}
```

## Authorization
Authorization determines what actions or resources a user is allowed to access based on their role or permissions.

```csharp
// Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // ... (Authentication setup)

    // Configure authorization services
    services.AddAuthorization(options =>
    {
        options.AddPolicy("AdminOnly", policy =>
            policy.RequireRole("Admin")); // Example: Only users with "Admin" role can access
    });
}
```

## Applying Authorization to Controllers and Actions
Apply authorization rules to controllers or actions using attributes.

```csharp
// UserController.cs
[Authorize] // Requires authentication to access any action in this controller
public class UserController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult Profile()
    {
        return View();
    }

    [Authorize(Policy = "AdminOnly")] // Requires "Admin" role to access this action
    public IActionResult AdminPanel()
    {
        return View();
    }
}
```

## Checking User Roles in Views
In your Razor views, you can conditionally render content based on user roles.

```html
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization

@if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
{
    @if (User.IsInRole("Admin"))
    {
        <p>Welcome, Admin!</p>
    }
    else
    {
        <p>Welcome, User!</p>
    }
}
else
{
    <p>Please log in to access this content.</p>
}
```

## JSON

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) in Brief:**

JSON is a lightweight format for sharing data between systems. It's easy for both humans and computers to grasp. Here's the lowdown:

- **Structure:** JSON uses key-value pairs, like a dictionary. Values can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or null.
- **Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "isStudent": false,
    "grades": [90, 85, 78]
  }
  ```
- **Advantages:** JSON is simple, lightweight, and well-supported in programming languages. It's perfect for web APIs and data sharing.
- **Usage:** It's used in web development for AJAX requests, configuration files, and more.
- **Parsing:** Languages provide tools to easily convert JSON to usable data. In JavaScript:
  ```javascript
  const jsonString = '{"name": "John", "age": 30}';
  const parsedData = JSON.parse(jsonString);
  console.log(parsedData.name); // Output: John
  ```
- **Security:** JSON itself doesn't handle security; applications need to ensure data safety.
- **Key Difference from XML:** JSON is lighter, simpler, and often preferred for modern applications.

In summary, JSON is a popular format for sharing and storing data in web development and beyond.

## Required Qualifications and Skills

### .NET C#
1. **CLR in .NET Framework:** The Common Language Runtime (CLR) manages runtime services in .NET. It compiles Intermediate Language (IL) to machine code and provides memory management and exception handling.

2. **Value Types vs. Reference Types:** Value types store data directly, while reference types store references. Value types include `int` and `bool`, while classes are reference types.

3. **Handling Exceptions:** Exceptions are runtime errors. We use `try-catch` blocks to handle them. For instance:
   ```csharp
   try
   {
       // Code that might throw an exception
   }
   catch (Exception ex)
   {
       Console.WriteLine($"An error occurred: {ex.Message}");
   }
   ```

### Writing RESTful Web Services
1. **REST Principles:** REST follows principles like statelessness and uniform interfaces. It uses HTTP methods to interact with resources.

2. **GET vs. POST:** GET retrieves data, POST sends data. GET is idempotent, POST is not.

3. **Pagination:** Use query parameters like `page` and `pageSize` to implement pagination.

### Angular
1. **Angular Components:** Components encapsulate UI elements. They consist of templates, styles, and logic.

2. **Two-Way Data Binding:** Data binding updates both view and model. Example: `[(ngModel)]` in forms.

3. **HTTP Requests with HttpClient:** Use `HttpClient` for requests. Example:
   ```typescript
   import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

   constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

   fetchData() {
       this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data').subscribe(response => {
           console.log(response);
       });
   }
   ```

### JavaScript
1. **`let`, `const`, and `var`:** `let` and `const` are block-scoped and allow reassignment. `var` is function-scoped and allows redeclaration and reassignment.

2. **Asynchronous Programming:** Promises and `async/await` handle asynchronous operations.

3. **Closures:** A closure allows a function to access variables from its containing function, even after it finishes. Example:
   ```javascript
   function outer() {
       const outerVar = 'I am outer';
       function inner() {
           console.log(outerVar);
       }
       return inner;
   }
   const innerFunc = outer();
   innerFunc(); // Outputs: I am outer
   ```

### Oracle and/or Microsoft SQL Server
1. **Normalization:** It reduces data redundancy and improves integrity. It divides tables into smaller related tables.

2. **JOIN Types:** INNER JOIN returns matching rows, LEFT JOIN returns all left rows and matching right rows, RIGHT JOIN is similar but from the right's perspective.

3. **Optimizing SQL Queries:** Create indexes, avoid `SELECT *`, optimize subqueries. Example: use `EXPLAIN` for query analysis.

### Git
1. **Version Control Purpose:** Git tracks changes, enabling collaboration and preserving code history.

2. **Git Workflow:** Developers create branches for features, push changes, and create pull requests for review and merging.

3. **Merge Conflicts:** Conflicts arise when Git can't merge changes automatically. Resolve by manually editing code and committing.
