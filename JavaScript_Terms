| Function | A block of code that can be defined and invoked to perform a specific task in JavaScript. | \`function add(a, b) { return a + b; }\` |
| Hoisting | A behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during compilation. | \`console.log(x); var x = 5;\` |
| JSON | JavaScript Object Notation, a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. | \`const person = { "name": "Alice", "age": 30 };\` |
| Promise | An object representing a value that might be available now, in the future, or never in JavaScript, often used for asynchronous operations. | \`const fetchData = () => new Promise((resolve, reject) => { fetch('https://api.example.com/data') .then(response => response.json()) .then(data => resolve(data)) .catch(error => reject(error)); });\` |
| Prototype | An object that serves as a base for other objects, allowing them to inherit properties and methods in JavaScript. | \`function Person(name) { this.name = name; } Person.prototype.greet = function() { console.log(\`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.\`); }; const person = new Person('Alice'); person.greet();\` |  
| Scope | The context in which a variable or function is accessible in JavaScript, often determined by where it is defined. | \`function foo() { var x = 10; console.log(x); } foo(); console.log(x); // Error: x is not defined\` |
| Strict Mode | A mode in JavaScript that enforces stricter parsing and error handling, reducing some silent errors and making debugging easier. | \`'use strict';\` |
| This | A keyword in JavaScript that refers to the current execution context, often used within functions and methods. | \`const person = { name: 'Alice', greet() { console.log(\`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.\`); } }; person.greet();\` |
| Type Coercion | The automatic conversion of values from one data type to another in JavaScript. | \`const sum = 5 + '10'; // '510'\` |
| typeof | An operator in JavaScript used to determine the data type of a value. | \`typeof 42; // 'number'\` |
| Undefined | A value in JavaScript that represents the absence of a value or uninitialized variables. | \`let x; console.log(x); // undefined\` |
| Var | A keyword used to declare variables in JavaScript, with function scope or global scope, often leading to unintended issues. | \`if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5\` |
| Let | A keyword introduced in ES6 to declare variables with block scope in JavaScript. | \`if (true) { let x = 5; } console.log(x); // Error: x is not defined\` |
| Const | A keyword introduced in ES6 to declare constants with block scope in JavaScript. | \`const PI = 3.14159;\` |
| Callback Hell | A situation in JavaScript where nested callbacks create complex and hard-to-read code, often encountered in asynchronous operations. | \`getData(function(data) { processData(data, function(result) { displayResult(result); }); });\` |
| Destructuring | A feature in JavaScript that allows you to unpack values from arrays or objects into distinct variables. | \`const numbers = [1, 2, 3]; const [a, b, c] = numbers;\` |
| Spread Operator | A syntax in JavaScript that allows you to spread elements of an iterable (like an array) into places where multiple elements are expected. | \`const array = [1, 2, 3]; const newArray = [...array, 4, 5];\` |
| Template Literal | A feature in JavaScript that allows you to create strings using backticks (`) and interpolate variables using ${}. | \`const name = 'Alice'; const greeting = \`Hello, ${name}!\`;\` |
| Rest Parameter | A feature in JavaScript that allows you to gather multiple function arguments into a single array parameter. | \`function sum(...numbers) { return numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0); }\` |  
| Map | A built-in JavaScript object that stores key-value pairs, where keys can be of any type. | \`const myMap = new Map(); myMap.set('name', 'Alice'); console.log(myMap.get('name'));\` |
| Set | A built-in JavaScript object that stores unique values of any type, providing an easy way to remove duplicates from an array. | \`const mySet = new Set([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]); console.log([...mySet]);\` |
| For...of Loop | A loop introduced in ES6 that iterates over iterable objects (arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.) in JavaScript. | \`const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; for (const num of numbers) { console.log(num); }\` | 
| Promises chaining | A technique in JavaScript where multiple asynchronous operations are chained together using promises to achieve sequential execution. | \`fetchData() .then(data => processData(data)) .then(result => displayResult(result)) .catch(error => handleError(error));\` |
| Fetch API | A modern JavaScript API for making network requests, providing a simpler and more flexible alternative to XMLHttpRequest. | \`fetch('https://api.example.com/data') .then(response => response.json()) .then(data => console.log(data)) .catch(error => console.error(error));\` |
| Async Functions | A feature in JavaScript that simplifies writing asynchronous code by allowing the use of await inside functions marked with the async keyword. | \`async function fetchData() { const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data'); const data = await response.json(); return data; }\` |  
| Generator Function | A special type of function in JavaScript that can pause and resume its execution, producing an iterator for generating a sequence of values. | \`function* generateNumbers() { yield 1; yield 2; yield 3; } const numbers = generateNumbers(); console.log(numbers.next().value);\` |
| IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) | A design pattern in JavaScript where a function is defined and executed immediately after its creation. | \`(function() { console.log('IIFE executed!'); })();\` |
| Module | A mechanism in JavaScript to encapsulate code and prevent global namespace pollution, often achieved using the export and import statements. | \`export function add(a, b) { return a + b; } import { add } from './math';\` |
| Web APIs | Interfaces provided by web browsers that allow JavaScript to interact with the browser environment, including DOM manipulation and network requests. | \`document.getElementById('myElement').addEventListener('click', () => { console.log('Element clicked!'); });\` |
