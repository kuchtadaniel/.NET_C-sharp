# Triage Process for Reported Software Issues using Bugzilla

## Overview
Software issue triage is a critical process in managing reported bugs effectively. It involves assessing, categorizing, prioritizing, and assigning issues to appropriate teams or individuals. This guide outlines the steps to follow when triaging reported software issues using Bugzilla.

## Steps:

1. **Access Bugzilla:**

3. **Assess Issue Validity:**
   - Review the reported issue for completeness and clarity.
   - Verify if the issue can be reproduced and whether it's a valid problem.

4. **Check for Duplicates:**
   - Search Bugzilla for existing issues that might match the reported problem.
   - Mark the new issue as a duplicate if an existing issue covers the same problem.

5. **Assign Components:**
   - Assign appropriate components and subcomponents to the issue to categorize it correctly.
   - Components help route the issue to the right team or individual.

6. **Assign Priority and Severity:**
   - Assign a priority level based on the impact and urgency of the issue.
   - Set a severity level based on the issue's impact on functionality.

7. **Add Keywords and Flags:**
   - Add relevant keywords and flags to the issue for better categorization and tracking.

8. **Gather Additional Information:**
   - If needed, request additional information from the reporter to reproduce the issue.

9. **Prioritize the Issue:**
   - Assess the issue's impact on users, business goals, and project timelines.
   - Assign a priority based on these considerations.

10. **Assign to Developers/QA:**
   - Assign the issue to the appropriate developer or QA team member for further analysis.

11. **Update Bug Status:**
   - Update the bug status to "Assigned" or a similar status based on your workflow.

12. **Communicate with Stakeholders:**

16. **Close the Issue:**
   - If the issue is verified and confirmed resolved, set the status to "Closed."

## Conclusion
Effective triaging of reported software issues is crucial for maintaining a productive development process. Following these steps using Bugzilla ensures that issues are properly categorized, prioritized, and assigned for resolution, leading to efficient issue management and improved software quality.
